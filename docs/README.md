By presenting a well-designed, informative site, the aim is to convey the value and warmth of the knitting club, encouraging visitors to engage further by visiting the shop or joining the club.

Future updates will provide business specific pictures and a place to display some of the work completed by members of the club, to make the website a more personable experience.

## Features

Here is a list of the features that are currently implemented on the website as well as plans for future features:

### Current Features:

### Navbar

- The navbar prominently displays the "Knit and Natter with Jan" logo, which serves as a welcoming emblem for your community of knitting enthusiasts.
- Clicking on the logo conveniently brings users back to the homepage, ensuring easy navigation and a home base for visitors to return. It is also has a fun hover effect to provide tactile feedback and improve the overall feel of the site.
- The navbar includes easy to understand menu options for different sections of the site, such as "Shop" "Club" and "Get in touch!"
- The entire navbar is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. On larger desktop screens it is a complete navbar with all sections are visible to be clicked on straight away. On mobiles and ipads it utilises a hamburger symbol and the menu utilises the 'offcanvas' effect to intuitvely appear from the side of the screen.

### Hero Image

- On opening the home page there is a hero image at the top of the screen. This fun design is to add a welcoming tone to the site and its tagline 'unwind with us'. Is both a fun pun and a call to action for the customer to visit while maintaining the chilled out 'vibe' that jan maintains in her business.
- The image is in fitting with the design of the page both in colour (of the wool pictured and the tagline) and in font though this has been styled by the designer.
- The image scales to different sizes depending on the screen size. This allows the entire image to always be visible.
- Similar images are used on other pages to add a sense of continuity across the site.

### Index Navigation Cards

- The navigation cards on the index page provide a concise and intuitive introduction to the various services offered by the business. They present information in an easily digestible manner, enabling users to quickly identify and navigate to the sections of interest for further exploration. This dual-purpose design efficiently fulfills both informational and navigational needs.
- They are stylised and animated on hover, this gives the user a robust tactile sense that they are clickable elements.
- They are adapatable to all screen sizes appearing as a row in larger screen sizes and in a column in smaller ones.
- Every card has an image attached, the image is relevant in some way to the page it links to at least thematically and allows for some visual story telling to provoke an emotional response from the user.

### Review Carousel

- The Review carousel was implented as a way to show off the good reviews of the business and to help create a feeling of security in the brand and a desire to get involved.
- It allows an interactive way for the the user to see several of the good reviews the business has recieved but in a way that doesn't take up too much screen real estate and clutter the site. Users who want to read multiple reviews can work across the carousel and read them and user who don't desire don't have to scroll through reams of text to get to the information in the footer.
- The carousel adapts to different screen sizes. In larger screen sizes (desktop, tablet) it is a visual feature. On smaller screen sizes it disappears altogether as to not clutter the site and keep it snappy. The carousel notably became unsightly under a certain size so it is removed to better suit the mobile styling.

### Footer

- The footer contains key information that users want to know and provides it in an easily accessible place that is consistent and the same across all pages.
- Opening hours are displayed in full along side the address and contact details of the business. 
- It is easy to read and clear.

### Brands We Stock Section

- The brands we stock section is an easy way to present customers with an idea of the sort of stock they are going to find inside of the shop.
- It's visual and easy to understand for anyone. 
- The logo's will be familiar to seasoned propsective customers, but even if not it's visual aspect doesn't hinder new knitters.

### Reasons to Join Section

- This uses bootstraps card system to provide 3 reasons to join the club in a visually pleasing and easy to read way.
- The font awesome icons give the information a visual aspect and help style the page.
- They adapt to different screen sizes in terms of layout.

### How to Find Us

- The 'How to Find Us' section includes a google maps intergration to give an easy visual cue to our location and an easy way to link out for direction.
- The address is provided in writing aswell, this is incase any issues arise with the google maps intergration.
- It is stylistically pleasing and easy for users to understand.

### Contact Form

- The contact form provides users with an easy way to contact the business quickly, directly from the webite. 
- It is simple and easy to understand. 
- The form asks for things the users are used to and is layed out in a similar fashion to other contact forms to lend an air of familiarity. 

## Future Features 

- First planned changes are in the content of the site. Better more bespoke images will replace or be added alongside stock images to create a more personable feel.
- A members log in with a place to share knitting patterns.
- A social media intergration or area for the business to self upload images of new things created by the club.
- In the medium to longer term, we envision incorporating an e-commerce aspect to the site.

## Typography and color scheme

### Colors:

![Colour Pallete](../docs/images/colour-pallete.jpg)

### Body: 

#FFFFFF is used on the body to give a clean base for styling.

### Logo, Icons, Buttons, Font-Awesome Icons and Miscellaneous Items:

#F499C1 This pink colour originates from the logo of the business. I have used it throughtout to give the business branding continuity.

### Bootstrap Container Icons:

#f499c054 This is a more transparent and paler change to the pink branding colour. It is moslty used as a background to text in bootstrap containers. It allows for continuity without over filling the page with the harsher logo pink and make it easier for users to read text.

### Text:

#333 black choosen to be easy to read over background colours and for its simple timeless nature.

## Fonts:

- The main font used in the website is 'Fira Sans' This was choosen for two reasons the main one it is legible and easy to read, but it is also the font from the 'knit and natter' section of the logo. This allows for the company branding to flow through the website.

- 'Caveat' is the other font used in the logo and this is used to style the 'with Jan' in the h1 on the index page. Also used for branding continuity.

### Test Cases


#### User Story Test Case: I want to be able to easily contact the shop/club, in order to address any questions that I may have.

![Homepage Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-1.jpg)

- On entering the website homepage I scroll down and see the 'Contact' and 'Get In touch' 

![Contact card Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-2.jpg)

- After seeing this large easy to understand element I click on it and I'm lead to the 'Contact' page.

![Contact page Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-3.jpg)

- Apart from the Navbar the first thing on the page is the Contact Form. Unfamiliar users may try to submit without filling out details. So the required element is in all fields to give them help and to make sure we don't receieve bad data.

- I may forget to fill out a segment, the website will prompt me to fill it out helping me avoid any confusion.

![Contact page 2 Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-4.jpg)

- Once all areas are filled out the submit button will then have an effect and send my message.

![Form Dump Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-5.jpg)

- I am then taken to the codeinstitute formdump page and my message is sent. I can then wait for a reply to my email address.

#### User Story Test Case: I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website in order to find out the information that I want.

- From the index page if I want to navigate I have two options. 

![Homepage Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-1.jpg)

- If I scroll down the page I come to the navigation card section. These are large cards that are fully clickable that give a summary of the different website pages and will navigate you there.

![Contact card 1 Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-a.jpg)
![Contact Card 2 Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-b.jpg)
![Contact Card 3 Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-c.jpg)

- On clicking anywhere on the card I am taken to my preffered part of the site and already have been given an indication of what I will find there beyond the title.

- Alternatively, on entering the website I see the navbar. On mobile and tablet I see the easily recongised and well known 'hamburger icon'. I know from experiece this will provide me with a menu.

![Hamburger Icon hightlighted Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-d.jpg)

- On clicking the icon I get an offcanvas menu giving me a list of easy to understand menu options I can quickly and easily navigate too.

![Offcanvas menu Screenshot](../docs/images/user-test-e.jpg)

User stories were tested on mobile as from research it is the more popular way to view websites now.



### Fixed Bugs

- When testing my website with my mentor we discovered that in smaller mobile screen sizes the padding for the text was off making the website unreadable. I implented a media query and changed a padding setting from a pixel amount to a percentage and this fixed the issue.

- My 'offcanvas menu' wasn't appearing correctly on some mobile screens initially. I made some changes with a media query and got this to work correctly.
