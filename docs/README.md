# Knit And Natter With Jan

The platform serves as a resource of information for who wish to know more about the business, offering detailed information about the shop, its offerings, and the vibrant community that gathers there.

## Features

Here is a list of the features that are currently implemented on the website as well as plans for future features:

### Current Features:

### Navbar:

-The navbar prominently displays the "Knit and Natter with Jan" logo, which serves as a welcoming emblem for your community of knitting enthusiasts.
-Clicking on the logo conveniently brings users back to the homepage, ensuring easy navigation and a home base for visitors to return. It is also has a fun hover effect to provide tactile feedback and improve the overall feel of the site.
-The navbar includes easy to understand menu options for different sections of the site, such as "Shop" "Club" and "Get in touch!"
-The entire navbar is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. On larger desktop screens it is a complete navbar with all sections are visible to be clicked on straight away. On mobiles and ipads it utilises a hamburger symbol and the menu utilises the 'offcanvas' effect to intuitvely appear from the side of the screen.

### Hero Image

- On opening the home page there is a hero image at the top of the screen. This fun design is to add a welcoming tone to the site and it's tagline 'unwind with us'. Is both a fun pun and a call to action for the customer to visit while maintaining the chilled out 'vibe' that jan maintains in her business.
- The image is in fitting with the design of the page both in colour (of the wool pictured and the tagline) and in font though this has been styled by the designer.
-The image scales to different sizes depending on the screen size. This allows the entire image to always be visible.
-similar images are used on other pages to add a sense of continuity across the site.

### Index nav cards

- The Navigation cards on the index page allow an introduction to the different services the business provides in a easy to digest way and a large easily understood way to instantly know how to naviage to where you can then learn more about those things. This allows two goals to be met at once.
- They are stylised and animated on hover this gives a nice user experience and robust tactile sense that they are clickable elements.
- They are adapatable to all screen sizes appearing as a row in larger screen sizes and in a column in smaller ones.
- Every card has an image attached, the image is relevant in some way to the page it links to at least thematically and allows for some visual story telling and provoke an emotional responce from the user.

### Review Carousel

-The Review carousel was implented as a way to show 0ff the good reviews of the business and to help create a feeling of security in the brand and a desire to get involved.
- It allows an interactive way for the the user to see several of the good reviews the business has recieved but in a way that doesn't take up too much screen real estate and clutter the site. Users who want to read multiple reviews can work across the carousel and read them and user who don't desire don't have to scroll through reams of text to get to the information in the footer.
- The carousel adapts to different screen sizes. In larger screen sizes (desktop, tablet) it is a visual feature. On smaller screen sizes it disappears altogether as to not clutter the site and keep it snappy. The carousel visually becomes unsitely under a certain size and this suited the mobile site style more also.

### Footer

- The footer contains key information that users want to know and provides it in an easily accessible place that is consistent and the same across all pages.
-Opening hours are displayed in full along side the address and contact details of the business. It is easy to read and clear.

### Brands We Stock:

- The brands we stock section is an easy way to present customers with an idea of the sort of stock they are going to do find inside of the shop.
-It's visual and easy to understand for anyone. 
-The logo's will be familiar to seasoned propsective customers, but even if not it's visual aspect doesn't hinder new knitters.

### Reasons to Join Section:

- This uses bootstraps card system to provide 3 reasons to join the club in a visually pleasing and easy to read way.
- The font awesome icons give the information a visual aspect and help style the page.
- They adapt to different screen sizes in terms of layout.

## Typography and color scheme

### Colors:

![homepage desktop wireframe](docs/images/colour-pallete-crop.jpg)

### Body : 

#white is used on the body to give a clean base for styling.

### Logo, icons, buttons, font-awesome icons and ancillary items :

#F499C1 This pink colour originates from the logo of the business. I have used it throughtout to give the business branding continuity.

### Bootstrap Container Icons :

#f499c054 This is a more transparent and paler change to the pink branding colour. It moslty used as a background to text in bootstrap containers. It allows for continuity without over filling the page with the harsher logo pink and make it easier for users to read text.

### Text :

#333 black choosen to be easy to read over background colours and for its simple timeless nature.

## Fonts 

- The main font used in the website is 'Fira Sans' This was choosen for two reasons the main one it is legible and easy to read, but it is also the font from the 'knit and natter' section of the logo. This allows for the company branding to flow through the website.

- 'Caveat' is the other font used in the logo and this is used to style the 'with Jan' in the h1 on the index page. Also used for branding continuity.
